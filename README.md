# Save The Children!

###Challenge Statement

Save the Children seeks your help to create an app that nutritionists can use on tablets for the counselling of mothers on how to feed their children. The app should combine information gathered through a UI from mothers regarding existing feeding practices over a week, with data held within the CotD databases about locally available foods and prices, to provide a pictorial representation of the nutritional content of the diet, and the cost of that diet compared with the suggested lowest cost diet. Within the app the lowest cost nutritious foods available in the area should be available for the nutritionist to suggest to the mother, which when selected can show the effect on nutrition and cost to the diet described. With this information the app will be able to suggest feasible nutrition recommendations for mothers, but also for mass national communication.


As the diet changes over time the app should be able to illustrate the effect on the growth of the child, and data recorded aggregated to provide population level data around feeding behaviours and child growth.
